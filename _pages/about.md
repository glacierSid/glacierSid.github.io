I am a Senior Data Scientist focusing on research in computer vision, statistical modeling, generative AI, and remote sensing to build optimized and automated end-to-end geoscience solutions.

Previously I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Center for Remote Sensing and Integrated Systems (CReSIS) at The University of Kansas. I focused on combining remote sensing with machine learning and deep learning models, towards climate change studies. My Ph.D. and Postdoctoral research dived into climate change by deep learning based iceberg detection and segmentation, and determining distribution laws that they follow around the Greenland Ice Sheet. This methodology used remote sensing imagery (optical & synthetic aperture radar), computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I created and managed large scale remote sensing datasets, with a focus on using open-source technologies and automation.

Along with my work, I also enjoy painting (mainly abstract expressionism, analytical cubism, and impressionism), and photography.
